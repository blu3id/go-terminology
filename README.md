About go-terminology
===============
This is a SNOMED terminology server. It replaces an older java-based microservice [rsterminology](https://github.com/wardle/rsterminology) and is, 
as far as I know, the first Golang implementation of SNOMED-CT. It uses protobuf as its persistence data structure.

It is still in active development but is now in production-use. It can drive a [fast free-text search engine](https://github.com/wardle/rsterminology2) by exporting an optimised protobuf-based index. It can import a SNOMED-CT distribution and has no runtime dependencies except a filesystem. Importantly, it supports read-only operation from a shared filesystem making it ideal for use as a scalable microservice.
